- Ian and Mathias finished their parts of the code and were only left with dividing it into the three architecture layers
- Rishabh finished his feature using an SQLite database but had to change it to stub implementation and divide it into layers/packages
 
Feb 17(1 hr)
- Kushal , Rahul , Hadi and Rishabh met the TA for COMP 3350 and he guided us for working with github.

						-Iteration 1 Work Summary-
    Main Problems faced
-There was a lot of problem in understanding how the github works and this took some time that otherwise we could have been spent on the features and other aspects 
 of the project

 frequent.
